  effect: >
   After each long rest, a creature afflicted with crystalline disease must make a [save w/con con]. On a success, nothing happens. On
   a failure, the creature suffers [roll 1 4] necrotic damage and has their Dexterity score reduced by one. A diseased creature's AC
   cannot be less than 10 + the difference between the creature's original and reduced Dexterity score, regardless of the armor the
   creature is wearing. If a creature's Dexterity score is reduced to 0, the creature is petrified (turned to solid crystal) until the
   disease is cured. Once the disease is cured, the Dexterity score reduction is removed.

   [roll 1 4 dex] slashing damage and the target must succeed on a [save w/con con] or contract crystalline disease and be poisoned.
   While poisoned in this way, a creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns. On a failure, the creature
   must make a save against crystalline disease, suffering the effect on a failure. On a success, the poisoned condition is ended.

   from the sharp crystal. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; hp 10; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to
   poison and psychic damage).

description:
- header: Crystal Tenders
  text: >
   Crystal spiders care for groves of crystals deep underground. They have the ability to extrude crystalline material, but only rarely
   do they spin it into anything resembling a traditional spiderweb, instead preferring to craft beautiful gemstone nodules on every
   available surface.

  text: >
   The bite of a crystal spider inflicts a disease that slowly turns the afflicted creature into a crystalline statue. The spiders seem
   to find the organic shapes of crystallized prey unattractive, because they always consume such unfortunate creatures and use them as
   raw building material for their favorite geometric patterns.
- header: Valuable Commodity
  text: >
   Crystal spiders are highly valuable, with live specimens worth upwards of 100 gc, and dead ones still being worth at least 30 gc.
   Many underground-dwelling races trade in crystal spiders, but the spiders are hard to find and defend their homes tenaciously.

   Crystal spiders were probably created from a mundane variety of spider that was warped by elemental energy.
