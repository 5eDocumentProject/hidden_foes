  onhit: >
   [roll 4 6] slashing damage and the target must make a [save w/con con], becoming poisoned on a failure. While poisoned in this way,
   a creature takes [roll 2 4] necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns as its flesh rots off its bones. A poisoned creature
   may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature dies while poisoned, it
   continues to rot at an incredible rate, being reduced to bare bones in [roll 1 4] minutes. Undead take double damage from
   the poison.
  special: >
   If the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, damage from the attack and poison is halved (but creatures already poisoned still
   take full damage).
flavor: A mass of black-and-white beetles roils across the ground.

   Bonestripper beetles are used by necromancers and undertakers to prepare skeletons for animation or burial. Criminals also pay a high
   price to dispose of corpses by having them eaten by bonestripper beetles.

   Bonestripper beetles were created by performing a series of arcane and alchemical experiments on ordinary carrion beetles. The
   modifications greatly increased the speed with which the beetles can clean a skeleton.
