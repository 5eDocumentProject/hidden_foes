  effect: >
   The necropolis sifter processes a skeleton in an adjacent space, coating the bones with an almost-imperceptible layer of protectant.
   A treated skeleton does not naturally decay. As part of this action, the sifter can also graft the back of the skeleton’s skull onto
   the skeleton’s face. If the sifter animates a skeleton that this procedure has been performed on, it animates as a
   [monster Boneplate Skeleton] instead of a regular one.

description:
- header: Keepers of the Dead
  text: >
   Necropolis sifters were originally created by the necromancy guild of an ancient city, with the job of keeping the city's
   mausoleums in order. The necropolis sifters then played a part in the subsequent takeover by the necromancy guild, and after the
   necromancers were destroyed, many of the sifters escaped destruction and were either put into service again by the new administration
   or took up a new existence in other underground passages.
