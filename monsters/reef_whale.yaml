  effect: >
   The reef whale's cavernous mouth is home to colonies of plantlike organisms that generate oxygen. As long as the whale is exposed to
   at least 10 hours of sunlight each day, there is breathable air inside the whale's mouth. If the whale has spent more than 16 hours
   in darkness, it must go to the surface every half-hour to replenish its air supply.

description:
- header: Living Ecosystem
  text: >
   Reef whales are enormous creatures that carry a reef-like ecosystem on their backs. They live near the surface of the ocean,
   where a colony of plants in the whale's mouth can generate oxygen for their host.
- header: Digestive Filaments
  text: >
   The back of the whale's mouth contains a number of sticky filaments that digest any food particles that get stuck on them.
   Any creature that touches a filament suffers 2 (1d4) acid damage, but the adhesive is not strong enough to hold any creature larger
   than a shrimp. The only openings in the mouth are a series of gill-like structures in the roof of the mouth to intake oxygen.
   Since the filaments in the mouth digest food, reef whales have no stomach.
- header: Oxygen Pockets
  text: >
   A reef whale's mouth is home to colonies of oxygen-generating plants. As a result, a healthy whale has a layer of breathable air
   trapped against the roof of its mouth. Any air-breathing creature can breathe from this pocket of air, but they have to be careful
   of the digestive filaments that line the mouth.

   Reef whales are almost completely harmless; they're large enough that very few things would bother to attack them, and they don't
   need to hunt for food. If anything poses a serious threat to one, their first defense would be to swim away. If they can't flee,
   they attack by ramming into their opponents. The reef whales also have an uncanny connection with the other animals that inhabit
   them, and can command the thousands of fish that dwell on their backs to form a school and attack.
