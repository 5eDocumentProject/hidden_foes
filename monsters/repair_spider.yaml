  text: >
   The repair spiders were designed to constantly be on the lookout for structural damage in buildings. If they found any damage, they
   are fully equipped to repair it, all without needing human assistance. They worked so well that, even long after the humans had left,
   the spiders kept working, keeping the ancient city from falling apart.
