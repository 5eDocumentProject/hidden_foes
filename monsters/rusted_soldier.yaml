  effect: >
   Some rusted soldiers have physiological variations. You can roll 1d8 on the following table to select such deviations.
   [numberlist
   Adds 1 to its rolls for the Unstable trait (max 6) &
   Int score increases to [stat 3] &
   Has blindsight out to 45 ft. instead of darkvision &
   Makes [roll 1 3] slash attacks instead of two when it takes the Multiattack action &
   Gains a climbing speed of 20 ft. &
   Con score increases to [stat 12], giving the soldier 10 additional hit points &
   Attacks deal 1d6 additional damage at distance instead of 1d4 &
   Roll twice]
- name: Unstable
  effect: >
   At the start of the rusted soldier's turn, as long as it is not incapacitated, roll 1d6 and consult the following table.
   [numberlist
   The soldier takes 1d4 damage &
   The soldier's movement speed is permanently decreased by 5 feet &
   The soldier takes 1d4 damage and its movement speed is increased by 5 feet for its next turn &
   The soldier gains 1d4 temporary hit points &
   The soldier takes 1d4 damage and its next attack deals 1d4 additonal damage &
   The soldier heals 1d4 hit points]
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  effect: The rusted soldier makes two slash attacks.
attacks:
- name: Slash
  type: mw
  reach: 10
  ability: str
  onhit: >
   [roll 1 6 str] slashing damage. This attack deals an additional [roll 1 4] slashing damage if the target is more than 5
   feet away.
  special: >
   Hit or miss, roll 1d6. On a 1, one of the soldier's slash attacks no longer does additional damage against targets that are
   further away, and can only target creatures that are more than 5 feet away.
flavor: >
 A simple bronze construct shambles forward, its cylindrical arms tipped with sharp blades. Rust-colored patches of mossy sludge coat
 its frame.
description:
- header: Products of a Fallen City
  text: >
   An ancient city-state developed a method for manufacturing huge numbers of mechanical soldiers. Vast machines, tended by a fleet
   of service constructs, endlessly churned out these soldiers. Eventually, the city-state collapsed, and a strange rusting disease
   infested the once-mighty city.
- header: Faulty Machines
  text: >
   All the metal in the city began to corrode, including the manufacturing plants. However, instead of crumbling into dust, the
   self-repair systems were able to combat the rust that contaminated the mechanical factories. Every once in a while, though,
   the repair systems would make minor mistakes in the reconstruction of the factories, and over the years these small errors added up.
   Eventually, the machines were building soldiers that only worked half of the time, and those that were functional very often had 
   structural problems (three arms, extra/no eyes, self-destructive tendencies, etc.).
- header: Short-lived Deviants
  text: >
   Since the factories were still running at full capacity, it did not take long before the remnants of the city were full of these
   mutant soldiers, and between the mechanical deficiencies and the all-consuming rust, a single construct would hardly last a
   week before breaking down and being recycled through the great foundries and factories into a new soldier.

   The few researchers that have managed to survive the mechanical hordes speculate that, eventually, the manufacturing facilities will
   be too badly damaged to possibly fabricate a functional construct... but that day is still many decades away.
