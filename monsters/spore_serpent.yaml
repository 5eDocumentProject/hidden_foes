abilities:
- name: Feed on Decay
  effect: >
   Whenever a creature within 30 feet of the serpent suffers necrotic damage, the serpent regains hit points equal to half the amount
   of damage dealt.
- name: Fleshrot Spores
  effect: >
   When a creature infected with fleshrot spores starts their turn, they must make a [disease_save]. On a failure, the creature loses
   [roll 1 3] Strength and takes [roll 2 6] necrotic damage. On a success, the creature takes [roll 1 6] necrotic damage. The disease
   is cured when the infected creature makes two consecutive successful saving throws. If a creature’s Strength score is reduced to
   zero by this disease, it dies. If a creature dies while diseased, it is reanimated in [roll 1 6] rounds as a [monster Fungal Hulk]
   under the control of the serpent. While the disease persists, lost Strength cannot be restored. Once the disease ends, the
   creature recovers lost Strength at a rate of 1 point per week. [spell Greater Restoration] or similar magic restores all lost Strength.
- name: Mindrot Spores
  effect: >
   When a creature infected with mindrot spores takes a long rest, they must make a [disease_save]. On a failure, the creature loses
   [roll 1 3] Charisma. If the creature’s charisma score is reduced to zero, they die and are reanimated in [roll 1 6] rounds as a
   [monster Fungal Thrall] under the control of the serpent. Lost Charisma cannot be restored while the disease persists. The disease
   is cured when the infected creature makes two consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Charisma can be
   restored as usual.
- name: Regenerative Spores
  effect: >
   When a creature infected with regenerative spores starts their turn, they must make a [disease_save]. On a failure, the creature gains
   [roll 2 4] temporary hit points and regains [roll 2 4] hit points. On a success, the creature gains [roll 2 4] temporary hit points.
   Plants, Undead, and creatures with zero hit points have disadvantage on their saving throw and gain twice as many temporary hit
   points and hit points. The disease is cured when the infected creature makes two consecutive successful saving throws. A creature
   infected with regenerative spores sprouts small fungal growths from their exposed skin, which are removed when the disease is cured.
   If a creature fails three consecutive saving throws against this disease, they become infected with fleshrot spores (90\% chance)
   or mindrot spores (10\% chance).

- name: Mushroom Wall
  uses: 3/day
  effect: >
   A wall of mushrooms 10 feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet thick erupts from the ground within 60 feet of the serpent. Any
   creatures where the mushrooms appear are pushed to the nearest empty space. The mushrooms can be attacked; each 5-foot cube of
   mushroom has AC 5, HP 30, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to necrotic, poison, and piercing from non-magical weapons.
   The mushrooms wither away after [roll 1 4] hours.
- name: Puffball
  uses: recharge 6
  effect: >
   A giant, white puffball erupts from the ground in an empty space within 60 feet of the serpent. When the puffball is touched or takes
   any amount of damage, or after [roll 1 4] rounds have passed, it explodes. All creatures within 15 feet of it must make a [disease_save],
   being afflicted with fleshrot, mindrot, or regenerative spores on a failure (the type of disease must be chosen when the puffball is
   created).
- name: Rot
  effect: >
   One living creature within 30 feet of the serpent must make a [save w/con con], taking [roll 2 6] necrotic damage on a failure or
   half as much damage on a success. Plants take double damage on a failed save.
- name: Spore Breath
  effect: >
   The serpent exhales a cloud of toxic spores in a 45-foot cone. All living creatures in the area must make a [disease_save],
