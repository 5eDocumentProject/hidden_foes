  effect: >
   Whenever the hive demon would suffer an effect that inflicts the poisoned condition and has a \"while poisoned in this way...\" clause,
   the next time the demon inflicts the poisoned condition, the \"while poisoned in this wayâ€¦\" effect also applies. If the stolen effect
   requires a saving throw, the save DC is the same as the DC from the original source. The poisoned condition does not end when the
   stolen effect ends.

  effect: >
   The hive demon is surrounded by a cloud of abyssal insects. At the start of the demon's turn, it can make a free Biting Swarm attack
   against any number of creatures within 20 feet. The swarm also provides the demon with a +6 AC bonus. At the start of the demon's
   turn, it can distribute this bonus among any number of creatures within 20 feet of it. The bonus remains distributed in this way
   until the start of the demon's next turn. If the demon has half health or less, the total AC bonus is reduced to +3.

   its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature can only suffer from one of the effects on the table at a time.

   If the hive demon has half its health or less, the attack roll has disadvantage and creatures have advantage on saving throws against
   the poison effect.

- header: Swarm Keepers
  text: >
   Hive demons host a huge swarm of demonic insects, with which they can communicate telepathically. The swarm is capable of transmitting
   a mild toxin through their bites, and can also provide protection simply by swarming around and on a creature, giving them a semblance
   of chitinous armor.

   Hive demons have the unique ability to steal poisons from other creatures, storing them up before inflicting them on their enemies
   either through their venomous bite or their demonic swarm.
