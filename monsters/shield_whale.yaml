description:
- header: Family Groups
  text: >
   Shield whales normally travel in pods of about ten individuals, led by the oldest female in the group. Their favorite foods are squid,
   octopus, and jellyfish, although they will eat almost any small animal in a pinch. Shield whales can be found in almost any part of
   the ocean, and can dive quite deep in search of food, although they must return to the surface at least once an hour to breathe.

   Shield whales are docile unless threatened, easily trained, and fiercely protective of their podmates. Many underwater
   cities are home to at least one pod of tamed shield whales that protect the city from other aquatic predators.
