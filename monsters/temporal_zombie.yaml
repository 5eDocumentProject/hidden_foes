  text: >
   When a chronomancer uses dark magic to steal another person's lifetime, the victim is transformed into a temporal zombie---not alive, but also not entirely dead. Such zombies
   quickly shrivel to a mummy-like state. Anything that takes effect over a period of time has almost no effect on a temporal zombie, a result of their existence in a sort of
   chronological limbo.
