 An herbarium slug looks somewhat like a mobile bed of moss. It slides along the ground, consuming any plant matter in its path and
 converting it into toxic, herbaceous growths on the slug's back.

   Herbarium slugs host many toxic plants which they use to defend themselves from predators. These same plants are often highly valued
   by alchemists and the like, and many are willing to pay for a herbarium slug, either living or dead.

   The first herbarium slugs were created when a mad druid accidentally animated his herb garden. The garden crawled off in several
   directions, taking many of the druid's most prized herbs with it. The slugs reproduce by fission, splitting into two smaller slugs
   once they have reached a certain size, and since that initial incident they have colonized the entire forest.
