description:
- header: Misdirecting Appearance
  text: >
   Although a skullblade appears to be a skeleton wielding a glaive, it is in fact the other way around. The sentient glaive bonds
   with a skeletal puppet, animating it so that it appears to be the true enemy.
- header: Ancient Bodyguards
  text: >
   The skullblades were forged ages ago by an ancient lich to serve as elite soldiers and bodyguards. The lich is long gone, but
   the skullblades remain, guarding the remnants of the lich’s domain.

  text: >
   When defeated, a skullblade falls inert and waits to be picked up by some hapless adventurer. Once the skullblade has been claimed,
   it slowly eats away at its owner’s life force until it can finally reanimate, using its erstwhile owner as its new skeletal puppet.
- header: Destruction
  text: >
   A skullblade cannot be destroyed or truly damaged by mundane means; it can merely be incapacitated. The only known way to permanently
   destroy a skullblade is to use it to kill a powerful undead creature---a skullblade wielded as a weapon crumbles to dust when used
   to deal damage to an Undead of CR 10 or higher.
