  text: >
   Knough are relatively small tree-folk that dwell in small colonies in the deep forest. Occasionally, lone knough can be found wandering the world in search of new species of
   trees or hunting creatures that did not respect the sanctity of their forests. Knough are friendly to any good-hearted travelers that stumble across their hidden villages,
   but for the most part prefer to keep apart from other races.
