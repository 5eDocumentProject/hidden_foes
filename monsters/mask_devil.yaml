  effect: >
   The mask devil carries four magical masks. If any of its masks are stolen, its maximum hit points are reduced by 20 for each mask
   stolen. If its maximum hit points are reduced to zero in this way, the mask devil explodes in a cloud of black smoke and a cacophony
   of high-pitched wails.
- name: Masquerade
  effect: >
   At the start of each of the mask devil's turns, it can choose one humanoid within 30 feet. It assumes the outward appearance of that
   creature, and its Str and Dex scores change to be the same as that creature's. The mask devil also has access to all weapon attacks
   that the creature has. The mask devil remains masquerading as that creature until it masquerades as a different creature or until
   it chooses to stop masquerading (which can be done at any time). When the mask devil dies, it reverts to its natural form before
   melting away in a cloud of black smoke.

   The mask devil's weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a hit (this is accounted for in the lash attack below).
actions:
- name: Multiattack
  effect: The mask devil makes three lash attacks, or two weapon attacks taken from the masqueraded creature.

  uses: recharge 5-6
  effect: >
   This ability can only be used when the mask devil is not masquerading as another creature. The mask devil may not use the same effect
   twice in a row. When the mask devil uses this ability, choose one of the effects below:
   [bulletlist
   Mask of Draining: One humanoid within 30 feet must make a [save w/cha cha], taking [roll 3 8] necrotic damage on a failure or
   half as much damage on a success. The mask devil gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. &
   Mask of Entrapment: One humanoid within 30 feet must make a [save w/cha cha] or be banished to a small demiplane, and the
   mask devil may immediately masquerade as that creature. A creature in this plane does not age and cannot be harmed in any way, and it
   cannot interact with the outside world in any way short of plane-shifting magic. While a creature is trapped in this way, the mask
   devil can always masquerade as that creature. Whenever the mask devil takes damage, it must make a [save w/cha cha]. On a failure, the
   trapped creature is released in an empty space within 30 feet. The creature is also released when the mask devil masquerades as a
   different creature. &
   Mask of Frailty: One humanoid within 30 feet must make a [save w/cha cha]. On a failure, that creature's Str score is reduced to 2,
   and the mask devil may immediately masquerade as that creature. The creature's Str score is restored when the mask devil stops
   masquerading as that creature. &
   Mask of Oblivion: All humanoids in a 30-foot cone must make a [save w/cha cha], taking [roll 6 6] psychic damage on a failure,
   or half as much damage on a success.]

  effect: >
   If the creature that the mask devil is masquerading as is within 30 feet when the mask devil is targeted by an effect that would cause
   damage, the mask devil may swap locations with the creature it is currently masquerading as, with the other creature taking the
   damage instead.

 This tall, humanoid figure is wrapped in a dark cloak that lashes as if in an invisible breeze. Four strange masks are tied
 at the devil's waist.

- header: Infiltrators
  text: >
   Mask devils are capable of infiltrating almost any humanoid society, where they try to obtain positions of power from which
   they can corrupt as many of the surrounding people as possible. Mask devils act like high nobility, expecting others to do their
   dirty work.
