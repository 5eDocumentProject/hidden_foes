description:
- header: Energy Collectors
  text: >
   The aether harvesters sport large harvesting arrays on their backs, which collect latent magical energy from the surrounding
   air. The harvesters store this energy in large internal batteries for transport back to their creators. If a harvester is
   destroyed while fully charged, it explodes in a devastating burst of raw magic.
