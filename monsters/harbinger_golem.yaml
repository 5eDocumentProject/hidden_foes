   An ancient city-state crafted eight of these golems, each one marked with a different phase of the moon. The golems were placed in
   a state of torpor inside of eight great towers, where they waited for a particular celestial alignment that heralded a coming
   cataclysm. When the stars aligned, the golems were to wake and protect the city from the approaching danger. Whether they ever did
   or not remains unknown.
