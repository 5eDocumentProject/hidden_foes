  text: >
   An ancient civilization captured embermoths, a type of magical, glowing insect, and used them to power simple constructs.
   The golems were capable of draining the embermoths for additional power or as extra weaponry, but doing so would lower
   their energy reserves for a short time, making them more vulnerable to attack.
