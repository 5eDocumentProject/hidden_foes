   These constructs were created by Maladrax the Golden to guard his vast treasuries. Of course, he had to forge them out of solid gold so that they wouldn't look out of place in
   said treasuries. The guardians were given a magic aura that draws the attention of any nearby creature, distracting them from the other ostentatious riches nearby.
