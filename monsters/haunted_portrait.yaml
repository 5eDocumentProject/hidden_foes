  text: >
   Haunted portraits are created when an especially vain person dies, but cannot bear to be separated from their beautiful face, and so
   end up haunting a portrait of themselves. Haunted portraits are not terribly dangerous, and since they can't move, they are very easy
   to avoid once noticed.
