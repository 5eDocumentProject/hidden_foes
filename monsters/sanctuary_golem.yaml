  text: >
   Sanctuary golems are mostly used by lawfully-aligned clerics to enforce the temple code of conduct. Each golem radiates an aura of
   calm, making it difficult to take any hostile actions, and its attacks are charged with holy energy against those who break the
   temple peace.
- header: Varied Appearance
  text: >
   The appearance of a sanctuary golem is largely dependent on the faith of the clerics that crafted it. For example, a temple of a
   nature-oriented deity might have sanctuary golems carved from wood, whereas a temple of a sea god might have sanctuary golems
   cobbled together from bits of coral.
