description:
- header: Defensive Seedpods
  text: >
   A spingum tree produces thousands of extremely sharp seedpods, which then drop to the ground, forming a formidable field of caltrops.
   Those who venture under a spinegum also run the risk of having seedpods fall on their heads. Because of the danger of walking beneath
   a spinegum, few animals bother to get close enough to eat its leaves or seeds. The nut-meat inside of a spinegum seed is edible,
   but is hard to gather in quantity and does not taste very good.
