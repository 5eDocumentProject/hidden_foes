description:
- header: Floating Nautiluses
  text: >
   Sky nautiluses fly by means of several gas-filled chambers inside their shells. Although the nautiluses can survive indefinitely
   in the air, most spend about half of their time in the water and the other half in the sky.

  text: >
   Sky nautiluses do not prey on large or landbound creatures, and so rarely come into conflict with any intelligent races. If threatened,
   their thick armor is usually enough to protect them until they can escape. Some races have built small fortresses on top of sky
   nautiluses and used them as beasts of burden.

- name: Golden Nautilus
  mods: >
   These nautiluses have a thick coat of golden algae-like slime on their shells. They have +1 AC, +1 Con, resistance to cold damage,
   and their fly and swim speeds are reduced by 5 feet.
