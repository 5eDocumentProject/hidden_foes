   The dangletrap weed itself is a thick vine that occupies a space about 15 feet wide, 15 feet long, and 3 feet high. From this vine grow
   hundreds of tentacles that are about 45 feet long, which dangle underneath the weed's area. Attacks against the tentacles do no damage
   to the weed, and any creature in the area occupied by the tendrils is a potential target for the weed's grasping tendrils.

   Dangletrap weeds have a primary rootvine from which hang a multitude of tentacles, somewhat similar to a jellyfish. The weed feeds by
   grappling any creature that walks into the curtain of tendrils, then pulling the creature up to its central vine where smaller tendrils
   can digest the weed's prey.

   Dangletrap weeds live on high tree branches or on the roofs of caverns, where other creatures are likely to walk into their long tendril
   curtains. There are stories of aquatic variants that live on the bottom of a body of water, and their tendrils float up above the weed
   instead of hanging down beneath it.
