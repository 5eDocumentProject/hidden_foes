  effect: >
   Any living creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the construct must make a [save w/wis con], being frightened of the
   construct on a failure. An affected creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on
   themselves on a success. Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw, it is immune to this constructâ€™s caged madness for 24 hours.

- name: Cage
  uses: recharge 6
  effect: >
   [roll 2 4 2] wooden spines erupt from the ground, forming a cage around a creature within 30 feet of the construct. The spines
   can be attacked (10 hp, 10 AC, immunity to psychic, resistance to piercing from non-magical weapons, vulnerable to fire). While the
   spines are in place, the creature inside the cage has half cover against all attacks originating from outside the cage, and creatures
   outside the cage have half cover against melee attacks from inside the cage.

   for one minute on a failure, or half as much damage and not being poisoned on a success.
flavor: This mostly-metal construct inexplicably has a profusion of flora growing from gaps in its armor.
description:
- header: Bound Fey Spirit
  text: >
   Feybound constructs are created by binding a fey spirit to a metal shell, thereby animating it. However, the spirit invariably loathes
   captivity and quite often goes mad, lashing out in an effort to destroy everything, especially its metal prison.
