   In even a light breeze, the flute golem emits an eerie flutelike noise that tears at the ears and mind. At the start of each of the golemâ€™s turns, as long as the air is not
   completely still, all creatures within 60 feet must make a [save w/con con], taking [roll 1 8] psychic damage plus [roll 1 4] thunder damage on a failed save, or half as
   much damage on a successful one.

  effect: >
   All creatures within 60 feet of the golem must make a [save w/con con], taking [roll 4 8] psychic damage plus [roll 2 8] thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
   on a successful one. If the creature fails the saving throw, all mental effects on the creature end (charmed, frightened, spells like suggestion or dominate person/monster,
   etc.) and the creature is stunned indefinitely. A creature stunned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
   a success. [spell Lesser Restoration] or similar magic can also end the stun effect.

flavor: This golem looks similar to an alien pipe organ, carefully constructed and tuned so that it keens an unearthly melody in even the slightest breeze.

   The flute golems were created by an aberrant race to serve as guardians for important locations. They are mostly found singly or in pairs 
   on strange planes, keeping watch over ancient outposts or derilect portal-like structures.
