  text: >
   Darkfire elementals are created by imbuing fire elementals with negative energy. If the ritual goes awry, it usually creates an
   ash elemental instead.

  text: >
   The balance between fire and shadow in a darkfire elemental shifts depending on the surrounding light. In brighter light, the fiery
   aspect of the elemental is more prominent, and in darkness, the opposite is true. Darkfire elementals are far more dangerous in the
   dark than in the light.
