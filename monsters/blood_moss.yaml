  text: >
   Blood moss hunts by waiting for a living creature to come near, and then lashing out with strong tendrils that grapple its prey amd
   draining the blood from its victim. If the area a blood moss inhabits becomes devoid of easy prey, the moss is capable of slowly
   crawling to new feeding grounds.
