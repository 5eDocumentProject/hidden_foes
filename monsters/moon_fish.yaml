description:
- header: Restorative Flesh
  text: >
   A serving of moon fish restores [roll 2 4] hit points, or restores one 1st-level spell slot. Moon fish are held sacred in many cultures,
   and so eating them is often forbidden, regardless of the restorative properties.

   It is somewhat unclear whether moon fish are true celestials, or merely ordinary fish somehow imbued with or possessed by some sort
   of spirit. Either way, it is rumored that the fish have the ability to swim to and from the moon, and the ones that get lost on the
   way become stars.
