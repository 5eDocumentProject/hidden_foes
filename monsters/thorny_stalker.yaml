 A thorny stalker looks like a roughly quadrupedal mess of vines, each tendril sporting long, razor-sharp thorns. Its most definite
 feature is its mouth---powerful jaws with vicious, needlelike teeth.

   Thorny stalkers are usually found either singly or in groups of four or five. They hunt in a way very similar to wolves, sometimes 
   chasing their prey across long distances before finally bringing it down. Unlike many predators, thorny stalkers completely ignore
   animals that are already dead.

   When a thorny stalker makes a kill, it leaves a small piece of one of its vines near the corpse. This vine takes root and grows
   quickly into a new thorny stalker. A mature thorny stalker usually lives for about two weeks before dying and rotting away.
