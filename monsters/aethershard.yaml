  text: >
   Aethershards are naturally occuring constructs composed of pure magical energy. As such, they are vulnerable to effects that
   dispel or suppress magic. Aethershards are highly volatile and unpredictable. The ones that occur naturally are especially unstable,
   sometimes so much so that they slowly self-destruct.
