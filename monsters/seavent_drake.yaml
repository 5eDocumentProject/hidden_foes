description:

  text: >
   These drakes dwell in the deepest reaches of the ocean, rarely coming to the surface for any reason. Although seavent drakes have
   rather unpleasant personalities, they have dedicated their existence to preventing the hidden evils of the ocean depths from emerging
   to wreak havoc on the world above.

   A seavent drake's horrifying array of fangs can inflict terrible bleeding injuries. When faced with a more powerful adversary, the drakes prefer to bite and then retreat and let
   their opponent bleed for a while before coming in again for another attack. When cornered, or when facing weaker foes, seavent drakes fight with unbridled ferocity.

   Seavent drakes are capable of breathing jets of cloudy, black, boiling hot water, similar to the emissions of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. This breath weapon is likely what
   gave the drakes their name.
