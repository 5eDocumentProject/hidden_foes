description:
- header: Book Keepers
  text: >
   Each tome guardian protects a single book, which is held safely within the construct's chest by strong chains. The guardian
   will only release its tome when ordered to do so by its creator.

   The chains that hold the guardian's tome in place also form the construct's weapons; the loose end of each chain is attached to a
   sword blade, allowing the guardian to wield them like flails. The guardian can also be badly damaged by forcefully unlocking its
   chains.
