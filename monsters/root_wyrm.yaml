   No one is certain where the first root wyrms came from. Some claim that a sect of druids created them to drive away a nest of
   purple worms that was intruding on the druid's territory. Others say that root wyrms have always existed and are just a natural
   creature.

   Root wyrms can live on just the soil that they burrow through, but they much prefer to consume fresher matter as a supplement to their diet.
   The wyrms seem to have a particular fondness for creatures of elemental earth, but will willingly eat anything that moves, and some things that don't.
