description:
- header: Soldiers of the Sun
  text: >
   Solar spirits are summoned by priests of sun deities to serve as soldiers. During the Shadow Wars, armies of thousands of solar
   spirits were deployed against the forces of darkness. The biggest weakness of solar spirits is that they can be warped into evil
   reflections of their former existence by sufficient quantities of dark energy.
- header: Obedient Servants
  text: >
   Although solar spirits are intelligent and capable of formulating their own tactics, they exist to serve as obedient soldiers.
   As such, they follow any commands to the best of their ability and stick to such instructions until destroyed, even carrying
   out obviously suicidal missions if necessary.
