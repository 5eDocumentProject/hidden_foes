   Use the variants from the sentry vine stat block, but with slight modification. The flowering sentry vine has a CR of [cr 4] instead
   of 0. The hydra sentry vine gains six additional hit dice, increasing its max hit points to [roll 16 10 32], loses a pod when
   it takes 20 or more slashing damage in a single turn, and has a CR of [cr 9].
