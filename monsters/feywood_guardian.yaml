- header: Ritual Creation
  text: >
   An ancient elvish civilization crafted the feywood guardians to protect their realm. The process involved carving a suit of armor from a special white wood, and then allowing
   certain types of vine to grow throughout the armor, before finally enchanting and animating the assembly through a lengthy ritual. With the fall of the elvish city, the process
   of creating feywood guardians was all but lost, known only to a few forest mystics who lack the resources to do anything with their knowledge.
