 Wood walkers are huge, bipedal plant creatures with a tough, wooden shell. They can emit clouds of floating spheres full of volatile
 gases that explode at the slightest touch.

  text: >
   Wood walkers occur naturally, but long ago a sylvan race captured many specimens and bred them to create an aggressive,
   well-armored weapon. The wild ones are much more docile, only attacking if threatened, and have been used as beasts of burden
   by some forest-dwelling druids.

  text: >
   The explosive spheres that a wood walker can eject are one of their most distinctive features. Each sphere is touch-sensitive, similar
   to a jellyfish's stinging cells, and contains a volatile compound that explodes on contact. A wood walker grows these spheres inside
   its wooden shell, taking about eight hours to grow a sphere from nothing to maturity.
