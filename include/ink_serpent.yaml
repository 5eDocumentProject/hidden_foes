effect: >
 When you cast this spell, you cover up to one square foot of surface area with text, using the material component. The first time
 that a creature reads the text, the ink slides off the page and coalesces into an [monster Ink Serpent] of the same color as the ink, which
 attacks the triggering creature. When you cast this spell, you may set conditions for creatures that donâ€™t trigger the spell,
 such as those who say a certain password. When the ink serpent or the creature that triggered the spell dies, the spell ends.
higher_levels: >
 If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, when the creature that triggered the spell dies, if the ink serpent
 is still alive, it returns to the surface the spell was cast on and disperses back into text, allowing the spell to be triggered
 multiple times.
