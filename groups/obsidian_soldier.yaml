   When the [name] is reduced to zero hit points, it is reduced to a Tiny orb of obsidian (10 hit points, same AC and
   resistances/vulnerabilities/etc. as the normal [name]). If this orb is not destroyed after [roll 6 4] hours, the [name] re-forms
   around the stone with full hit points.

- header: Three Forms
  text: >
   An ancient curse transformed a large swath of land into a barren waste of flat obsidian. Eventually, it was discovered that this
   obsidian could be quarried, carved, and animated. The resulting constructs are generally made in one of three forms: a basic soldier
   type, a larger and dangerous type known as an obsidian hulk, and a more intelligent type capable of casting acid-based spells.

  text: >
   These constructs are carved like statues from solid blocks of obsidian. The magic that animates them allows them to bend, although
   no joints are included in their construction. At the core of each construct is a small sphere of obsidian, which remains behind after
   the construct is destroyed. After several hours, if this heart is not destroyed, it regenerates the construct.
- header: Obsidian Hulk
  text: >
   Obsidian hulks are crafted from a single large block of obsidian, and look like a pillar of roiling water turned
   suddenly to glass. The hulks can manifest pseudopod-like appendages for long enough to attack an opponent with, after which the
   tentacle merges back with the rest of the hulk's body.

   The obsidian mages are quite intelligent for constructs, and are capable of casting minor acid spells. They usually serve as
   commanders of other obsidian constructs. Despite their additional intelligence, they are still completely obedient to their
   creator.
