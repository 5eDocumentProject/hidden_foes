 This grove of long, thick vines sports several huge, sweet-smelling flowers and roughly conical seed pods. The pods fire explosive
 packets of needle-sharp seeds at any creature that wanders too close.

   Sentry vines grow quickly from a seed to the flowering stage. Each vine has a single flower, which matures into the seed-firing
   fruit body that is the most dangerous feature of a sentry vine. A single sentry vine usually has 6 (2d4 + 1) packets of seeds to
   fire. Soon after firing all of its seeds, the sentry vine will wither away. In some varieties, the root bulb survives and puts out a
   new vine eventually, but many types simply die after dispersing their seeds.

   Sentry vine flowers are huge, almost two feet across, and have a mesmerizing aroma. Groves of sentry vine often have several vines
   in the flowering stage, which attract animals to be attacked by the vines in the fruiting stage.

   There are reports of rare varieties of sentry vine that have multiple seed-firing heads or that grow to incredible sizes, but it
   is unknown whether or not these rumors have any basis in fact.
