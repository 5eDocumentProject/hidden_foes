   Grutches live around small towns, spending most of their time eating rats and causing mischief. Although their rat-eating prowess
   is a great help to most farmers, people still see them as bad luck, in large part because of the inherent danger of having grutches
   nearby.

   If a grutch ever hears its name spoken out loud, it immediately transforms into a being of much greater power. For obvious reasons,
   every grutch's fondest dream is to be promoted to a greater grutch, and so many of their tricks are simply efforts to get the
   exasperated villagers to say the magic word.
