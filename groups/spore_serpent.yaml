  text: >
   Spore serpents live off of decaying matter, dwelling in dark, damp places full of mold and fungus. Many spore serpents serve deities
   of rot and decay as spies or attendants, but an almost equal number are content to mind their own buisness and cultivate alien gardens
   of mushrooms.

   The diseases that spore serpents spread turn the afflicted into fungal slaves. These servants come in two principal categories: some
   are strong hulks of rotting matter, and some appear almost as they did in life. The first kind
   serve as bodyguards for the spore serpent, and are usually found throughout its lair. The second kind is sent abroad to infiltrate
   nearby settlements and bring the serpent news of the outside world.
